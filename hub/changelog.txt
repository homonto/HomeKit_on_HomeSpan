2022-12-16:
- 1.0.5 - MAX_WEBLOG_ENTRIES=180 (5 hours for 3 sensors each 5 minutes) to reduce memory usage
        - shorten weblog text and added memory heap printed
        - even if USE_MAX17048 but is not connected of faulty: don't check battery and don't send alarming messages
        - initial values changed:
                charging = 0
                low battery = 0 (no alarm)
                battery percent = 50 (to avoid 0% if battery is not measured)        
        - timeout increased to 30 minutes (1800s) - to make sensors device faulty on HomeKit

2022-12-16:
- 1.0.3 - WEBLOG for 24h for 3 sensors

2022-12-15:

2022-11-28:
- 1.0.0 - big day: 1.0.0

2022-11-27:
- 0.5.0 - fw_version unified (same on sensors and the bridge)
- 0.4.6 - disable OTA on webserver as it only works inside LAN and takes a lot of memory 

2022-11-26:
- 0.4.5 - 
        - consolidate checking volts and checking charging in one task
        - adding DEBUG_XTASKS to estimate stack size for vTasks
        - optimizing stack size for led_blink() and check_volts
        - change xTaskCreatePinnedToCore to xTaskCreate - let software decide which core to use
        - add: board_build.partitions = min_spiffs.csv to platformio.ini to enable Inspector in PIO
- 0.4.4 - free heap checking in check_volts(), restart ESP if < MIN_ALLOWED_HEAP_SIZE (20kB)
- 0.4.3 - fw_version reworked again: "0.4.3" - only numbers here, major: 0-99, minor: 0-9, patch: 0-9, so 0.4.3 would be 43, no seconds in fw_version
- 0.4.2 - fw_version, serial_number: both changed on bridge, fw_version has date/time of compilation, serial_number has both macs

2022-11-25:
- 0.4.1 - FW update for BRIDGE finished
- 0.4.0 -
        - FW update from web on press "ID" in Eve for HomeKit (check how to in Home.app)
        - ESP32-S2 discontinued - not enough memory
        - new SN introduced: last 6 char of new MAC and last 6 char of old MAC
- 0.3.4 - bootcount implemented on SENSOR DEVICES
- 0.3.2 - charging showing on HomeKit, battery level on HomeKit

2022-11-23:
- 0.2.0 - added battery to sensors (in %)
